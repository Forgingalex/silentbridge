# silentBTC

silentBTC is a Stacks intent bridge for `STX` and `sBTC`.

The product lets a user lock one asset, set a minimum acceptable return, choose a routing preference, and wait for a solver to fulfill the swap with pre funded liquidity. If the intent is still pending, the user can reclaim escrow and exit cleanly.

This repository contains two tracks:

1. A Mainnet release track for `STX <-> sBTC`
2. A broader sandbox track for local work and testnet experiments

## What ships to Mainnet

The Mainnet release is intentionally narrow.

1. `STX -> sBTC`
2. `sBTC -> STX`

`USDCx` stays out of Mainnet scope.

## Safety model

silentBTC is built around four protections.

1. Exact post conditions protect the asset leaving the wallet.
2. Every Mainnet intent stores a minimum acceptable output.
3. Pending escrow can be reclaimed by the user.
4. Solver liquidity is tracked separately from user escrow.
